# Simmons 3C Clicker

The dorm I currently live in is called Simmons. The lounge group I'm in is called "a Society"
(now I can unironically say "We live in a society" ;D), better known as "3C" because, well,
most of us live in section C of floor 3.

Like any other friend group, we have inside jokes, inside memes, funny moments, whatever you
call them. This clicker game (inspired by games like Cookie Clicker) honors those epic moments.

Have fun :).

You might have to reload the page a few times to get the game
to display correctly; I'm not quite sure why this is the case.
